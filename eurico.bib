abstract="Neural Network approaches to time series prediction are briefly discussed, and the need to find the appropriate sample rate and an appropriately sized input window identified. Relevant theoretical results from dynamic systems theory are briefly introduced, and heuristics for finding the appropriate sampling rate and embedding dimension, and thence window size, are discussed. The method is applied to several time series and the resulting generalisation performance of the trained feed-forward neural network predictors is analysed. It is shown that the heuristics can provide useful information in defining the appropriate network architecture.",

journal="Solar Physics",

volume="215",
number="1",
pages="99--109",
abstract="The latitudinal distribution of sunspot groups over a solar cycle is investigated. Although individual sunspot groups of a solar cycle emerge randomly at any middle and low latitude, the whole latitudinal distribution of sunspot groups of the cycle is not stochastic and, in fact, can be represented by a probability density function of the $\Gamma$ distribution having maximum probability at about 15.5{\textdegree}. The maximum amplitude of a solar cycle is found to be positively correlated against the number of sunspot groups at high latitude (â‰¥35{\textdegree}) over the cycle, as well as the mean latitude. Also, the relation between the asymmetry of sunspot groups and its latitude is investigated, and a pattern of the N-S asymmetry in solar activity is suggested.",

  abstract={We compare the capabilities of different nonlinear algorithms for forecasting chaotic time series when a limited number of past values of the series is available, a situation most often found in real-world problems. In particular, we consider instance-based methods and neural network techniques, which are frequently advocated in the literature as universal, simple, and fairly reliable algorithms for time-series analysis. Furthermore, we propose a linear correction to the instance-based Wimplex method that produces remarkably good results on clean data. Finally, we present a preliminary application of the ideas discussed here to the real-world series of solar activity, which is often taken as a benchmark for these kinds of studies.}

abstract="Two nonlinear methods are employed for the prediction of the maximum amplitude for solar cycle 23 and its declining behavior. First, a new heuristic method based on the second derivative of the (conveniently smoothed) sunspot data is proposed. The curvature of the smoothed sunspot data at cycle minimum appears to correlate (R > 0.92) with the cycle's later-occurring maximum amplitude. Secondly, in order to predict the near-maximum and declining activity of solar cycle 23, a neural network analysis of the annual mean sunspot time series is also performed. The results of the present study are then compared with some other recent predictions.",

The paper first summarizes the current methods for determining the input dimension of the neural network. Then inspired by the fact that the correlation dimension of a nonlinear dynamic system is the most important feature of it, the paper presents a new idea that the input dimension of the neural network for nonlinear time series prediction can be taken as an integer just greater than or equal to the correlation dimension. Finally, some validation examples and results are given.}

For this class of infinite-dimensional systems, the low-order model identification from process data is very important in practice. The dimension reduction with a principal component analysis (PCA) is only a linear approximation for nonlinear problem. In this study, a nonlinear dimension reduction based low-order neural model identification approach is proposed for nonlinear distributed parameter processes. First, a nonlinear principal component analysis (NL-PCA) network is designed for the nonlinear dimension reduction, which can transform the high-dimensional spatio-temporal data into a low-dimensional time domain. Then, a neural system can be easily identified to model this low-dimensional temporal data. Finally, the spatio-temporal dynamics can be reproduced using the nonlinear time/space reconstruction. The simulations on a typical nonlinear transport-reaction process show that the proposed approach can achieve a better performance than the linear \{PCA\} based modeling approach. "

For the Kâ€“S equation, numerical simulations using a pseudospectral Galerkin method is presented at a bifurcation parameter Î±=17.75, where a dynamical behavior represented by a heteroclinic connection is obtained. We apply Kâ€“L decomposition on the numerical simulation data with the task of reducing the data into a set of data coefficients. Then we use \{ANN\} to model, and predict the data coefficients at a future time. It is found that training the neural networks with only the first data coefficient is enough to capture the underlying dynamics, and to predict for the other remaining data coefficients. As for the two-dimensional Nâ€“S equation, a quasiperiodic behavior represented in phase space by a torus is analyzed at Re=14.0. Applying the symmetry observed in the two-dimensional Nâ€“S equations on the quasiperiodic behavior, eight different tori were obtained. We show that by exploiting the symmetries of the equation and using Kâ€“L decomposition in conjunction with neural networks, a smart neural model is obtained. "

abstract = {This paper reports empirical evidence that a neural networks model is applicable to the statistically reliable prediction of foreign exchange rates. Time series data and technical indicators such as moving average, are fed to neural nets to capture the underlying "rules" of the movement in currency exchange rates. The trained recurrent neural networks forecast the exchange rates between American Dollar and four other major currencies, Japanese Yen, Swiss Frank, British Pound and EURO. Various statistical estimates of forecast quality have been carried out. Obtained results show, that neural networks are able to give forecast with coefficient of multiple determination not worse then 0.65. Linear and nonlinear statistical data preprocessing, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Hurst exponents for each currency were calculated and analyzed.},

pages="1457--1477",
abstract="We analyze the yearly mean sunspot-number data covering the period 1700 to 2012. We show that the yearly sunspot number is a low-dimensional deterministic chaotic system. We perform future predictions trying to forecast the solar activity during the next five years (2013{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}2017). We provide evidence that the yearly sunspot-number data can be used for long-term predictions. To test and prove that our model is able to predict the Maunder Minimum period (1645{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}1715), we perform long-term post-facto predictions comparing them with the observed sunspot-number values. We also perform long-term future predictions trying to forecast the solar activity up to 2102. Our predictions indicate that the present Cycle 24 is expected to be a low-peak cycle. We conclude that the level of solar activity is likely to be reduced significantly during the next 90 years, somewhat resembling the Maunder Minimum period.",

abstract="Because of the ``all-or-none'' character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.",

  abstract={Sunspots are a canonical marker of the Sun's internal magnetic field which flips polarity every ~22Â yr. The principal variation of sunspots, an ~11Â yr variation, modulates the amount of the magnetic field that pierces the solar surface and drives significant variations in our star's radiative, particulate, and eruptive output over that period. This paper presents observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and Solar Dynamics Observatory indicating that the 11Â yr sunspot variation is intrinsically tied to the spatio-temporal overlap of the activity bands belonging to the 22Â yr magnetic activity cycle. Using a systematic analysis of ubiquitous coronal brightpoints and the magnetic scale on which they appear to form, we show that the landmarks of sunspot cycle 23 can be explained by considering the evolution and interaction of the overlapping activity bands of the longer-scale variability.}

  title={Prediction of Solar Activity from Solar Background Magnetic Field Variations in Cycles 21-23},
  journal={The Astrophysical Journal},
  volume={795},
  number={1},
  pages={46},
    year={2014},
  abstract={A comprehensive spectral analysis of both the solar background magnetic field (SBMF) in cycles 21-23 and the sunspot magnetic field in cycle 23 reported in our recent paper showed the presence of two principal components (PCs) of SBMF having opposite polarity, e.g., originating in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Over a duration of one solar cycle, both waves are found to travel with an increasing phase shift toward the northern hemisphere in odd cycles 21 and 23 and to the southern hemisphere in even cycle 22. These waves were linked to solar dynamo waves assumed to form in different layers of the solar interior. In this paper, for the first time, the PCs of SBMF in cycles 21-23 are analyzed with the symbolic regression technique using Hamiltonian principles, allowing us to uncover the underlying mathematical laws governing these complex waves in the SBMF presented by PCs and to extrapolate these PCs to cycles 24-26. The PCs predicted for cycle 24 very closely fit (with an accuracy better than 98%) the PCs derived from the SBMF observations in this cycle. This approach also predicts a strong reduction of the SBMF in cycles 25 and 26 and, thus, a reduction of the resulting solar activity. This decrease is accompanied by an increasing phase shift between the two predicted PCs (magnetic waves) in cycle 25 leading to their full separation into the opposite hemispheres in cycle 26. The variations of the modulus summary of the two PCs in SBMF reveals a remarkable resemblance to the average number of sunspots in cycles 21-24 and to predictions of reduced sunspot numbers compared to cycle 24: 80% in cycle 25 and 40% in cycle 26.}

abstract="Prediction of spatio-temporal field evolution is based on the extraction of a physical law from joint experimental data. This extraction is usually described by a set of differential equations. If the only source of information is a field record, a method of field generators based on nonparametric modeling by conditional average can successfully replace differential equations. In this article we apply the method of field generators to a two-dimensional chaotic field record that describes the asynchronous motion of high-amplitude striations. We show how to choose the model structure in order to optimize the quality of the prediction process.",

	abstract = {Neighborhood detection and local state vector construction for the identification of spatiotemporal systems is considered in this paper. Determining the neighborhood size both in the space and time domain can considerably reduce the complexity of the set of candidate model terms for the identification of coupled map lattice models. The computation requirements of the model identification algorithm can also be greatly reduced instead of the more direct identification approach of searching over the entire spatiotemporal neighborhood in the original space. In this paper, a new neighborhood detection method is introduced based on embedding theory for nonlinear dynamical systems to produce an initial spatiotemporal neighborhood for the identification of spatiotemporal systems. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the new neighborhood detection method.},
