% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  %declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  %and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  %every instance of \includegraphics

\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
We show empirical evidence on how to construct the optimal feature selection or architecture for the input layer on a neural network used for forecasting of spatial-temporal series. The approach is based on results from dynamical systems, namely the non-linear embedding theorems. We demonstrate it for a two dimensonal signal with one spatial dimension and one time dimension, and show that the optimal input layer seems to consist
of a two dimensional grid, with spatial/temporal lags determined by the minimum of the mutual information of the spatial/temporal signal subsets
and the number of points taken in space/time decided by the embedding dimensional of signal. We support our evidence by running a Monte Carlo simulation of several combinations of input layer architecture and showing that the one decided by the non-linear embedding theorems seems to be
optimal or close of optimal.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} this paper we show empirical evidence for an optimal architecture of the input layer of a neural network which tries
to forecast or predict a spatial temporal signal. Here we show the empiral evidence for two particular cases of 
two dimensional data series $s^n_m$ (one spatial,
one temporal dimension). By two dimensional data series we mean a scalar field which can be
defined by a $N\times M$ matrix with components $s^n_m \in \mathbb{R}$.

\subsection{Neural networks for time-series forecasting}

Describe the use of feedforward artificial neural networks, then recurrent networks and other methods (put all references).

\subsection{Neural networks for spatial temporal forecasting}

There has been several attemps to forecast spatial-temporal data series in the literature ( add references). The references above
confine themselves to articles that attempt to forecast the actual full scalar field  $s^n_m$, as opposed to the ongoing research on
pattern recognition in moving images (2D and 3D), which attempt to pick particular features in images (e.g. car, pedestrian, bicycle,
person) and to forecast where those features will be in subsequent images within the particular moving sequence. 

\subsection{Sunspot and solar data series forecasting using neural networks}

Neural networks, among other forecasting methods (add references) has been used extensively to try to predict sunspots and related
data series. Mostly this has been done in time only (add references). There are a few examples (add references) of actual spatial temporal
forecasts using neural networks (see mine and the one on MDI/HDI data).

\subsection{Input layer architecture for neural networks for spatial temporal forecasting}

All of the references above on neural network forecasting of spatial temporal data series either use a simple delay based architecture
for the input layer, or use a time delay based on the first minima of the {\em mutual information} as proposed in 
\cite{Fraser86, abarbanel1997analysis, opac-b1092652}) and/or use the number of points dictated by
the embedding theorems by \cite{key1503303m}, \cite{1981LNM...898..366T, 1981LNM...898..230M} and \cite{1991JSP....65..579S}
using the method of {\em method of false nearest neighbours} detection suggested by
\cite{1992PhRvA..45.3403K} and reported in detail in
\cite{1992PhRvA..45.7058M, 1993RvMP...65.1331A, 1996PhT....49k..86A, abarbanel1997analysis}.

However, as far as we are aware, all the references to using the embedding theorems and the related  mutual information
method and the false nearest neighbours method seems to be not justified, i.e., the approach is explained but not proven
either theoretically or empirically. Here we use two examples of spatial temporal signals, one a real world data series, another
a synthetic signal, to demonstrate that there seems to be empirical evidence for an underlying theorem for what the optimal 
 neural network feature selection for forecasting of spatial-temporal series should be.

} have already
attempted to use neural networks to forecast aspects of the sunspot cycle, although none in both space and time, having restricted themselves to
using these neural networks to forecast mostly either the sunspot number or the sunspot areas as a function of time. 

Takens established the theoretical background \cite{1981LNM...898..366T} in the Takens embedding theorem. Further developments established a 
series of  theorems by \cite{key1503303m}, \cite{1981LNM...898..366T, 1981LNM...898..230M} and \cite{1991JSP....65..579S}.

Some authors discuss the use of either mutual information and/or embedding dimension as a constraint on the input layer, i.e. the feature selection.
\cite{annunziato, Gkana201579, Zachilas2015, Sun2010109, HUANG20108590, 298224, Frank2001, 1998GeoRL..25..457K, BUHAMRA2003805, chandra2012cooperative, DBLP:journals/corr/MaslennikovaB14, sauter2010spatio, JiangS11, inputlayer, 1997IJMPC...8.1345K,
1009-1963-12-6-304, Verdes2000, 1996SoPh..168..423F, 2007AdG....10...67L, Chandra:2012:CCE:2181341.2181747, raios, maaß2003mathematical} used the
mutual information and/or the false nearest neighbours' methods to estimate the suitable embedding parameters.

\cite{0305-4470-28-12-012, 1995ApJ...444..916C, 1998GeoRL..25..457K, Zachilas2015, Chandra:2012:CCE:2181341.2181747, Gkana201579, raios} attempted to forecast the solar sunspot number using neural networks and they used the
embedding dimension of the sunspot time series as way to define the architecture of the input layer. 

\cite{Simon:2007:HDS:1230147.1230294} generalize the mutual information approach to higher dimensions but do not connect it to the problem of the 
neural network input layer architecture optimization.

There are also papers \cite{articleRagulskis} that try to use neural networks to determine the optimal embedding and time delay for the purposes of local
reconstruction of states with a view to forecast.

There are also papers \cite{Xia2006APF} that use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to forecast in space and time and use time delays and embedding approachs to define
the states vectors.

In fact Parlitz and Merkwirth \cite{Parlitz2000NonlinearPO} in the
ESANN 2000 meeting proceddings paper mentioned that local reconstruction of states ``\ldots may also serve as
a starting point for deriving local mathematical models in terms of polynomials,
radial basis functions or neural networks.''. Here we attempt to show empirical evidence that this is not just 
a starting point, but the optimal neural network input architecture.

% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

of a randomly choosen architecture get close to the supposely optimal architecture ones, the SSIM converges to what seems to be the
best possible forecast value given the limited (and noisy) dataset.}

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]

%\end{tabular}

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.




\section{Conclusion}
We have shown empiral evidence for the existence of an optimal architecture of the input layer of neural networks used for forecasting
spatial-temporal series.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
