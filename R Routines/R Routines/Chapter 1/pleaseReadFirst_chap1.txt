extension .R and should execute when entered 
into a R workspace.

Listing 1.1

Listing 1.2
main_1p2.R

Listing 1.4
main_1p4.R

Listing 1.5

Listing 1.3 is not included here since it is
just a sample of R code that is included in 
Listing 1.4.

Please report any problems in executing these
R routines to the author at wes1@lehigh.edu.
