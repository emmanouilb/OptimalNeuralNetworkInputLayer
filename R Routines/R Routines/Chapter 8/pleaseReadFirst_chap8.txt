                  Chapter 8

       Spline Collocation Analysis of
       Partial Differential Equations

The R routines in Chapter 8 are listed below
according to the discussion of the listings
in the chapter text.  The routines have an 
extension .R and should execute when entered 
into a R workspace.

Listing 8.1
pde_1a_main.R

Listing 8.2
pde_1a.R

pde_1b_main.R
This routine is not listed in the text of
Chapter 8, but is provided here so that
pde_1b.R can be used.

Listing 8.3
pde_1b.R

Listing 8.4
pde_1c.R
This routine is discussed in the text of
Chapter 8, but a main program is not discussed.
A main program can be developed from the
main program pde_1a_main.R of Listing 8.1 as
discussed in Chapter 8.

The main programs have a setwd (set working
directory) statement that requires editing for
the local computer to specify the directory
(folder) with the R routines.  The path is
based on / and not the usual \, for example,
setwd("f:/collocation/chap8")

Please report any problems in executing these
R routines to the author at wes1@lehigh.edu.
