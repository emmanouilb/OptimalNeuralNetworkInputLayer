       Spline Collocation Analysis of
       Partial Differential Equations

The R routines in Chapter 11 are listed below
according to the discussion of the listings
in the chapter text.  The routines have an 
extension .R and should execute when entered 
into a R workspace.

Listing 11.1
pde_1a_main.R

Listing 11.2
pde_1a.R

Listing 11.3
ua_1.R

Listing 11.4
uat_1.R

The main program has a setwd (set working
directory) statement that requires editing for
the local computer to specify the directory
(folder) with the R routines.  The path is
based on / and not the usual \, for example,
setwd("f:/collocation/chap11")

Please report any problems in executing these
R routines to the author at wes1@lehigh.edu.
