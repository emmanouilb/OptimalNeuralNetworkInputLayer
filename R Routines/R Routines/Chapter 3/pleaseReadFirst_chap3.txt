                  Chapter 3

       Spline Collocation Analysis of
       Partial Differential Equations

The R routines in Chapter 3 are listed below
according to the discussion of the listings
in the chapter text.  The routines have an 
extension .R and should execute when entered 
into a R workspace.

Listing 3.1a
pde_2a_main.R

Listing 3.1b
pde_2a.R

Listing 3.2a
pde_3a_main.R

Listing 3.2b
pde_3a.R

Listing 3.3a
pde_3a_main_dnr.R
dnr (for Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary 
conditions) was added to the file name to 
distinguish it from pde_3a_main.R of Listing 
3.2a (based on Neumann boundary conditions)

Listing 3.3b
pde_3a_dnr.R
dnr (for Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary 
conditions) was added to the file name to 
distinguish it from pde_3a.R of Listing 3.2b 
(based on Neumann boundary conditions)

Each main program has a setwd (set working
directory) statement that requires editing for
the local computer to specify the directory
(folder) with the R routines.  The path is
based on / and not the usual \, for example,
setwd("f:/collocation/chap3")

Please report any problems in executing these
R routines to the author at wes1@lehigh.edu.
