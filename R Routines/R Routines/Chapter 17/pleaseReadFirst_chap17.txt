                  Chapter 17

       Spline Collocation Analysis of
       Partial Differential Equations

The R routines in Chapter 17 are listed below
according to the discussion of the listings
in the chapter text.  The routines have an 
extension .R and should execute when entered 
into a R workspace.

Listing 17.1
pde_1_main.R

Listing 17.2
pde_1.R

The main program has a setwd (set working
directory) statement that requires editing for
the local computer to specify the directory
(folder) with the R routines.  The path is
based on / and not the usual \, for example,
setwd("f:/collocation/chap17")

Please report any problems in executing these
R routines to the author at wes1@lehigh.edu.
