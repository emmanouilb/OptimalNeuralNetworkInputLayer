                  Chapter 14

       Spline Collocation Analysis of
       Partial Differential Equations

The R routines in Chapter 14 are listed below
according to the discussion of the listings
in the chapter text.  The routines have an 
extension .R and should execute when entered 
into a R workspace.

Listing 14.1
pde_1_main.R

Listing 14.2a
pde_1.R

pde_1a_main.R
This routine is discussed but not listed in 
the text of Chapter 14.  It is included here 
to test pde_1a.R of Listing 14.2b.

Listing 14.2b
pde_1a.R

Listing 14.3
ua_1.R

The main programs have a setwd (set working
directory) statement that requires editing for
the local computer to specify the directory
(folder) with the R routines.  The path is
based on / and not the usual \, for example,
setwd("f:/collocation/chap14")

Please report any problems in executing these
R routines to the author at wes1@lehigh.edu.
