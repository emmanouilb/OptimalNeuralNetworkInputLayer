       Spline Collocation Analysis of
       Partial Differential Equations

The R routines in Chapter 2 are listed below
according to the discussion of the listings
in the chapter text.  The routines have an 
extension .R and should execute when entered 
into a R workspace.

Listing 2.1
pde_1a_main.R

Listing 2.2
pde_1a.R

Listing 2.3
pde_1a_main_nbc.R
nbc (for Neumann boundary conditions) was
added to the file name to distinguish it
from pde_1a_main.R of Listing 2.1 (based on 
Dirichlet boundary conditions)

Listing 2.4
pde_1a_nbc.R
nbc (for Neumann boundary conditions) was
added to the file name to distinguish it
from pde_1a.R of Listing 2.2 (based on 
Dirichlet boundary conditions)

Listing 2.5
pde_1a_main_rbc.R
rbc (for Robin boundary conditions) was
added to the file name to distinguish it
from pde_1a_main.R of Listing 2.1 (based on 
Dirichlet boundary conditions)

Listing 2.6
pde_1a_rbc.R
rbc (for Robin boundary conditions) was
added to the file name to distinguish it
from pde_1a.R of Listing 2.2 (based on 
Dirichlet boundary conditions)

Listing 2.7
pde_1a_main_nlbc.R
nlbc (for nonlinear boundary conditions) was
added to the file name to distinguish it
from pde_1a_main.R of Listing 2.1 (based on 
Dirichlet boundary conditions)

Listing 2.8
pde_1a_nlbc.R
nlbc (for nonlinear boundary conditions) was
added to the file name to distinguish it
from pde_1a.R of Listing 2.2 (based on 
Dirichlet boundary conditions)

dss044.R
Some of the applications use this library
spatial differentiation routine

Each main program has a setwd (set working
directory) statement that requires editing for
the local computer to specify the directory
(folder) with the R routines.  The path is
based on / and not the usual \, for example,
setwd("f:/collocation/chap2")

Please report any problems in executing these
R routines to the author at wes1@lehigh.edu.
