abstract = {Transition to turbulence in pipe flow is one of the most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow remains
laminar for all flow rates, but in practice pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate
speeds. This transition drastically affects the transport efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for the transition process has been suggested. We report experimental observation of these traveling waves in pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these unstable states may indeed capture the nature
of fluid turbulence.

   The complex interactions between spatial and temporal components of the dynamics, 
    known as spatiotemporal chaos, only recently begun to be studied using ideas from 
    fundamental dynamical systems theory 
    (Temam, 1988; Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997). 
    The present dissertation is primarily interested in studying the appearance 
    of global bifurcations in two specific physical examples, a laser with an 
    injected signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface. Characteristic 
    of these bifurcations is the presence of a highly degenerate ....
    One of the main motivations to study these equations is that some of them display 
    spatiotemporal chaos, which in many ways, resembles turbulence in fluid dynamics. 
    Recently, different efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these complex states 
    have been developing (Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997).

  abstract={The problem of understanding the nature of fluid flow through a circular straight pipe remains one of the oldest problems in fluid mechanics. So far no explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the transition process by which the steady unidirectional laminar flow state gives way to a temporally and spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent) solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new travelling wave solutions have been discovered which are saddle points in phase space. These plausibly represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of spatio-temporal periodic flow solutions which may be used to construct a cycle expansion theory of turbulent pipe flows. We summarize this success against the backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for future research. }

generalizations of the trace formula valid in the presence of a non-Abelian continuous symmetry. The usual trace formula must be modified in such cases because periodic orbits occur in continuous families, whereas the usual trace formula requires that the periodic orbits be isolated at a given energy. These calculations extend the results of a previous paper, in which they considered Abelian continuous symmetries. The most important application of the results is to systems with full three-dimensional rotational symmetry, and they give this case special consideration.
